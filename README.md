Exploration agent: The exploration agent will first check if the gold is in the room. Then it will check if the room contains stench and if it does it will shoot in the direction it is facing.  If no scream was heard then it can move forward. If it percepts the breeze then it will move forward if no breeze is percept in that next room then the agent knows that the pit was on the left or right of the previous room.
